## Structures

1. The Jupyter notebooks at the root contains the workflow of how we solved the problems we encountered. Especially, the notebook **NN.ipynb** is the pipeline of our implementation of Neural Network.

2. The **utils** folder contains all the python classes we created. They are in a modular manner and well documented.

3. The **NN1_model_summary** contains information and plots not shown in the reports as well as additional information concerning NN1. The **NN2_model_summary** contains information and plots not shown in the reports as well as additional information concerning NN2.

4. The **vadere-code** folder contains the files we modified and added to the vadere simulation, mainly kNearestPedestrianProcessor

5. The **vadere-project** contains the vadere project with all the scenarios, including bottleneck andcorridor with different parameters etc.
